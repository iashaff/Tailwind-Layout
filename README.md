# Tailwind Layout

Tailwind Layout is a simple layout built with the [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS framework.

Tailwind CSS is an open-source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.
